## CS554 Course Project: Car Repair

This project is designed to depict the scenario of the Car Repair Center. This
center provides three types of repairs: Engine repair, Body repair, and Wheels repair.
Along with the main Car Repair Office, there are Mechanics who will be fixing the car,
and there are Inspectors who will be checking if the repair has been done properly. Now
Guest will approach the Car Repair Office with a specific type of repair request for the
first type along with some initial credit. The Car Repair Office will register the guest by
adding him to the ledger and assign him a Mechanic which the Guest can approach
directly. Usually Guest prefers his car being handled by the same Mechanic. But every
time a Guest approaches the Mechanic for repair, the Mechanic should get approval
from the Car Repair Office. The Car Repair Office will check if the Guest has a sufficient
credit balance. If yes, then this request will be approved. The Car Repair Office will cut
down the repair cost from available credits associated with that Guest from the ledger.
The Car Repair Office will also suggest the Inspector to the Mechanic so that after
completion of repair Mechanic can directly approach the Inspector. On completing an
inspection, Inspector will give a green signal to the Mechanic so that he can hand over
the Car to the Guest. Guests will go for a Test Drive and return after some amount of
time with a new repair issue. For the sake of simplicity, each Guest will always come with
the same type of Repair request initially mentioned. Now for the second time Guest can
directly approach the Mechanic assigned to him. One Mechanic can handle multiple
Guests one by one. The same goes for the Inspector. If either of them is busy, then
requests will be added in Queue. Both repair work and inspection take a specific amount
of time, based on the type of repair
